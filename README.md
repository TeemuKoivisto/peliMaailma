# peliMaailma

This MEAN-app is a side-project for testing game AIs. Some of it has been coded in Typescript, most of it is just plain Javascript. It deploys to [Heroku.](https://peli-maailma.herokuapp.com)

Once you've downloaded it use "npm install" to install Node packages, "bower install" to install front-end dependencies. After that you simple type "gulp nodemon" to start the server which should automatically restart when any changes have been made to files (excluding Gulp-files and created new folders). No Livereload so you should use F5 to refresh the page after each restart.
